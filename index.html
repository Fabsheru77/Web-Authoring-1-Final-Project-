            The first person to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant was named Khalid. However, no direct evidence has been found earlier than the 15th century, or even where coffee was first cultivated. The story of Khalid, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered the stimulating effect of coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans and leaves from a coffee plant. His goats become energized and excited, prancing about the fields After eating the berries, himself, Khalid felt equally as elated. He rushed home to share his discovery. Which did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably later.
